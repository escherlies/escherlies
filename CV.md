# Work Experience

## 2022 June - ongoing - [CoffeeChat.ai](https://www.coffeechat.ai)

<!-- <picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="./images/coffee_chat_ai_logo_full_dark.07f5b22.svg"><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./images/coffee_chat_ai_logo_full_light.30d9e27.svg"><img src="./images/coffee_chat_ai_logo_full_dark.07f5b22.svg" width="80px" align="right"></picture> -->

At coffeechat.ai I developed a matching plattform for weekly employee meetings. 

The backend is build with Haskell and Servant. The frontend with Elm. It runs on NixOS with systemd-services and -timers for scheduled tasks.


## 2020 Oct - ongoing - [HyHyve](https://www.hyhyve.com/)

<!-- <img src="./images/hyhyve.svg" width="130px" align="right"> -->

At HyHyve I developed an interactive meeting plattform where the user can move around freely and get connected
with other users at proximity. <br/>
The UI is built entirely with Elm, and the gaming engine with functional TypeScript. The backend is built with
TypeScript and runs on NodeJS. The infrastructure is realized and managed with docker containers and accommodates
a microservice architecture with multiple servers. All the servers run on NixOS.<br/>


## 2017 Apr - ongoing - Freelance Full-Stack Developer

In my freelancing work, I built a backend with microservices, wrote APIs, released an app for iOS and Android, created a web platform, configured Linux servers, made DevOps pipelines, worked with lambda and cloud functions, wrote tests, integrated payment services, worked with various databases (NoSQL, SQL, Graph), built a PWA and wrote software documentation.

I also designed and implemented a suitable software architecture for the respective projects. I used React, React Native, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Google Cloud functions, MongoDB, SQL, DGraph, (JavaScript), Typescript, C, PHP, Python, and Linux.

I studied Haskell (with its proponents of side-effect-free, functional programming).

## 2017 Apr - 2020 Aug - Kitabote

At Kitabote I developed a web, and ios and android app for kindergardens. The app was a hybrid react native app and was a react web app.
The tasks included writing a front and backend, API, file server, setting up ci/cd pipelines and analystics.
